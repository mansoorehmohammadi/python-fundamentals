# UiS Preparatory Course 2020
This repository contains the exercises for the first day of the DATPREP course. The exercises can be found inside the `exercises` directory.

### Setting up the coding environment 
We recommend you to install anaconda and work on Jupyter notebook. If you are familiar with python programming, you can choose whatever tool that you want to use.

#### Anaconda
The core component to proceed with the course, Python3 and Jupyter notebook should be installed. There are various ways to set up the environment. However, we recommend you to use [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

#### Installation ([Windows](resources/jupyternotebook-win.pdf), [MacOS](resources/jupyternotebook-mac.pdf))
1. Download Python 3 version from the Anaconda [website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
    - The exact version should be python 3.8.
1. Install on your local machine.
1. All the necessary resources (e.g., Python) will be installed while installing Anaconda.

## Getting help
* If you are working outside the scheduled exercise time, feel free to send an email to the lecturerer of a given day.
* Most questions can be answered by searching on the internet. If you are not familiar with Python at all, we recommend you to take a look at an online Python course(e.g., [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/index.html), [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)).
